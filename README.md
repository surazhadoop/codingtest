Thank you for this Assignment.
It was fun working on it.

The Program would work on both s3 as well as local mode.
I have used Spark Core module just to write as close as Scala programming

The Program assumes we have a aws credentails file in the local machine where it runs.
Unit test cases are also written to handle all possible cases. The unit test cases are running in the local mode.

Main Program:
codingtest/src/main/scala/CodingMain.scala

The Code is written in the distributed way so that it can work in parallel no matter what size of file and number comes.
I have provided comment through out the code just to make sure it is understandable as much as possible.
